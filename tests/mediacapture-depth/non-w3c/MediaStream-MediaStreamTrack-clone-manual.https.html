<p class="instructions">Use a test device with depth camera(embedded or external) and an audio device.</p>
<p class="instructions">When prompted, accept to share your audio and depth streams.</p>
<h1 class="instructions">Description</h1>
<p class="instructions">This test checks that A cloned MediaStream contains clones of all 
member tracks from the original stream. A cloned MediaStreamTrack has a set of constraints
that is independent of the instance it is cloned from.</p>

//what's the different from test: Tests that a MediaStream Depth constructor follows the algorithm set in the spec?
